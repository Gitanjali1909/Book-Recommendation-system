🌟 About the Project

This project is a Book Recommendation System that suggests books similar to the ones you already like. It uses content-based filtering on genres, authors, and descriptions to recommend titles.

I built it to get hands-on experience with real-world datasets, feature engineering, and recommendation algorithms. Plus, it has a simple Streamlit app so you can try it out interactively.

🛠️ How It Works

-Data & Cleaning
Loaded goodreads_books.csv from Kaggle.
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, parsed genres/authors.
Converted ratings to numbers and saved the clean dataset as books_cleaned.csv.

-Feature Engineering
Encoded genres & authors with one-hot encoding.
Transformed book descriptions with TF-IDF (5000 features).
Combined everything into a single sparse feature matrix.

-Model
Used cosine similarity to measure closeness between books.
Precomputed and saved the similarity matrix for fast lookups.
Wrote a recommend() function that returns similar books (title, author, rating, snippet, and Goodreads link).

-UI (Streamlit)
Dropdown autocomplete for book titles.
Sidebar filters for number of recommendations and rating ranking.
-Clean two-column layout with book cards:
Title (clickable to Goodreads)
Author, rating (⭐ stars)
Short description (expandable for more)
